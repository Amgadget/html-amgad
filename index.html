<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised
during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic
Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion
to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic
Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was
placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except
for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later
critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His
paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has
been said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was hostile to
the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and
ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he
maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as
Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify.
The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not
forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable
successors".[14]</p>






Amjad's Journey in Information Technology
Amjad's passion for technology began at a young age, growing up in a household that valued innovation and curiosity.
 From tinkering
 with gadgets to building his first computer, his enthusiasm for engineering was evident early on.
  This passion led him to pursue 
a degree in Information Technology Engineering, a field that perfectly combined his love for problem-solving and 
cutting-edge technology.
Throughout his studies, Amjad excelled in courses such as programming, data structures, and network security. His 
dedication to 
learning and his inquisitive nature set him apart from his peers. He spent countless hours in the lab, experimenting
 with different
 coding techniques and collaborating with classmates on various projects.
One of his most significant achievements during his academic journey was developing a smart home automation system.
 This project not
 only showcased his technical skills but also his ability to innovate and think critically. His professors often 
 praised him for his
 perseverance and creativity, qualities that were also reflected in his personal life.
Outside of academics, Amjad was an active member of the university's tech club, where he organized workshops and
